## Resources used to develop and deploy Enthusy Bot

Enthusy Bot was built using [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html).

[JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) was used to generate random jokes.

Enthusy Bot uses [Repl.it HTTP hosting server](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/deploying-http-servers) to host the bot on the server that will stay awake and active until an hour after its last request.

The [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) monitoring service was used to upkeep Enthusy Bot by pinging the bot in the background every 5 minutes to stay awake and active consistently.
